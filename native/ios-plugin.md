# iOS Plugin System

Writing the iOS native code for a DevKit plugin is covered in this guide, which
uses the [Accelerometer plugin](http://github.com/gameclosure/accelerometer),
the [GeoLoc plugin](http://github.com/gameclosure/geoloc), the
[Airpush plugin](http://github.com/gameclosure/airpush), and the
[TapJoy plugin](https://github.com/gameclosure/tapjoy) as examples.


For an overview of the plugin system, the requisite directory structure, and
how to write the JavaScript component of the plugin, please see the [main
plugin development guide](../guide/plugins.html).



### Usage

First install the plugin with `devkit install [plugin repository path]` while
in the root of your application folder.
For example:

~~~
devkit install https://github.com/gameclosure/accelerometer
~~~

This will install the accelerometer plugin in your modules folder and will
add the installed tag to the dependencies list in your manifest.json.


And do a full build:

~~~
devkit debug native-ios --clean
~~~

This will add the required frameworks and code for the plugin to the native
stack so that it will be present during runtime.

Some plugins require additional configuration.  Please read the README.md file
that comes with the plugin to see what additional steps you should take to use
it.

The iOS Test App *does not* work with native plugins at this time.  You will
see warnings that look like:

~~~
{plugins} WARNING: Event could not be delivered for plugin: AccelerometerPlugin
~~~

### iOS Plugin: ios/config.json

Under `addons/geoloc/ios/config.json` is the configuration used while building
iOS targets with the GeoLocation plugin.

It specifies the code and frameworks needed to build the iOS plugin:

~~~
{
	"resources": [
		"libphonenumber.plist"
	],
	"code": [
		"GeoLoc.h",
		"GeoLoc.mm"
	],
	"userDefined": [
		"facebookAppID",
		"facebookDisplayName"
	],
	"plist": {
		"FacebookAppID": "$(facebookAppID)",
		"FacebookDisplayName": "$(facebookDisplayName)",
		"CFBundleURLTypes.CFBundleURLSchemes": "fb$(facebookAppID)"
	},
	"frameworks": [
		"CoreLocation"
	]
}
~~~


##### Resources

Adding files under the "resources" key will cause them to be copied into the
`resources.bundle` alongside the `native.js.mp3` file containing the JS code
for your game.  This is an advanced feature for plugins that require extra
configuration files present in the resources bundle.  As an example, it is
useful for using the [iOS port of
libPhoneNumber](https://github.com/me2day/libPhoneNumber-iOS) since it requires
external configuration files like "NBPhoneNumberMetadata.plist" in the
resources bundle.


##### Code

The `code` array files are added to the Xcode project during build.

The supported file types are:

+ C/C++ Header Files: ".h", ".hpp"
+ C/C++ Source Files: ".c", ".cpp", ".cc"
+ ObjC/ObjC++ Source Files: ".m", ".mm"

Source files are automatically added to the build files in the Xcode project.
They will be visible under the `platforms` group in the file view in Xcode.

Inside the `code` files you can `#import` any file in the TeaLeaf Xcode project
by the base file name without being concerned by the absolute path.  For
instance, the `GeoLoc.mm` file can include the header that is added with
`#import "GeoLoc.h"`.  It can also access any other existing files in the
project.

Furthermore these files are referenced instead of being copied.  The generated
Xcode project contains references back to the addon files, and any changes to
these files in Xcode will be preserved in the file system between `devkit`
builds.  This accelerates plugin development since you can iterate quickly to
test new code.

##### UserDefined

The `userDefined` array specifies a list of keys under the "ios" section of the
game's manifest.json that get set as user-defined keys in the Xcode project
generated during iOS builds.

These user-defined keys are useful for defining `plist` key values based on
data from a game's manifest.json.

See for example the following `config.json` section:

~~~
	"userDefined": [
		"facebookAppID",
		"facebookDisplayName"
	],
~~~

In this example the value of the "android:facebookAppID" key from manifest.json
will be stored in an injected `$(facebookAppID)` user-defined Xcode variable.
For the Facebook plugin this is used to set the FacebookAppID Info.plist key to
the correct value.

##### PList

The `plist` map is useful for injecting or modifying PList keys nearly anywhere
in the `TeaLeafIOS-Info.plist` XML tree used for configuration in the generated
Xcode project.

The key in the `plist` map is the key that will be added to the PList.  This is
the "raw" key rather than the one displayed in the Xcode interface, so be sure
to look at the file in a text editor to discover the raw key.

The value is a literal string that can also contain user-defined keys from the
game's manifest.json by referencing them with $(userDefinedKeyName).  See the
section above on `userDefined`.

Take for example the following `config.json` section:

~~~
	"userDefined": [
		"facebookAppID",
		"facebookDisplayName"
	],
	"plist": {
		"FacebookAppID": "$(facebookAppID)",
		"FacebookDisplayName": "$(facebookDisplayName)",
		"CFBundleURLTypes.CFBundleURLSchemes": "fb$(facebookAppID)"
	}
~~~

In this case the key "FacebookAppID" will be added to the `Info.Plist` file
during building.  The string value for the key will be taken from
`ios:facebookAppID` in the game's manifest.json since the `userDefined` section
lists "facebookAppID" as a user-defined key.

Also note that `CFBundleURLTypes.CFBundleURLSchemes` references a key that is
two-deep in the XML structure of the plist file.  By separating the keys with
dots, you are able to inject anywhere in the hierarchy.  When the final subkey
after the last dot is found to be an array, the given string will be added to
the array.  If the subkey is not found, it will be injected with the given
string.

##### Frameworks

Any frameworks your code requires can be added to the `frameworks` array.

The supported file types are:

+ System frameworks: No extension.
+ Static libraries: ".a"
+ Custom frameworks: ".framework"
+ Custom bundles: ".bundle"
+ Custom XIB: ".xib"
+ System dylib: ".dylib"

The extension determines the type of linkage desired:

###### Frameworks: System frameworks

Pass in unqualified names such as `CoreLocation` (not `CoreLocation.framework`)
for system frameworks.  Be sure to include the header in your plugin code
(`#import <CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h>`).

~~~
...
	"frameworks": [
		"CoreLocation"
	]
...
~~~

###### Frameworks: Static libraries ".a"

For static libraries, pass in a file path relative to the `ios` directory
containing the `config.json` file for iOS.  As an example you may add a new
static library under `addons/geoloc/gcif_reader.a`  And in this case the
`ios/config.json` file would contain:

~~~
...
	"frameworks": [
		"CoreLocation",
		"../gcif_reader.a"
	]
...
~~~

###### Frameworks: Custom frameworks ".framework"

For custom frameworks, add `MyFramework.framework` to the "frameworks" list,
    with a `.framework` extension.

Place the framework file in the `ios` subdirectory of your plugin.

~~~
...
	"frameworks": [
		"CoreLocation",
		"FacebookSDK.framework"
	]
...
~~~

###### Frameworks: Custom bundles ".bundle"

For custom bundles, add `MyBundle.bundle` to the "frameworks" list, with a
`.bundle` extension.

Place the bundle file in the `ios` subdirectory of your plugin.

~~~
...
	"frameworks": [
		"CoreLocation",
		"./MoPubSDK/Resources/MRAID.bundle"
	]
...
~~~

###### Frameworks: Custom XIB ".xib"

For custom XIB files, add `MyXIB.xib` to the "frameworks" list, with a `.xib`
extension.

Place the XIB file in the `ios` subdirectory of your plugin.

~~~
...
	"frameworks": [
		"CoreLocation",
		"./MoPubSDK/Internal/Common/MPAdBrowserController.xib"
	]
...
~~~

###### Frameworks: System dylib ".dylib"

For system dylib files, add `libsqlite3.dylib` to the "frameworks" list, with a
`.dylib` extension.

~~~
...
	"frameworks": [
		"Security",
		"libsqlite3.dylib"
	]
...
~~~

### iOS Plugin: Code

##### GCPluginProtocol

Your plugin class is required to respond to the following selectors in
`PluginManager.h`:

~~~
@protocol GCPluginProtocol
@required
- (void) initializeWithManifest:(NSDictionary *)manifest appDelegate:(TeaLeafAppDelegate *)appDelegate;
~~~

And it can optionally respond to these additional selectors for your convenience:

~~~
@optional
- (void) didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error application:(UIApplication *)app;
- (void) didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo application:(UIApplication *)app;
- (void) didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken application:(UIApplication *)app;
- (void) didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification application:(UIApplication *)app;
- (void) applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)app;
- (void) applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)app;
- (void) handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url;
@end
~~~

If you need additional selectors please discuss them with us.

##### Header

The GeoLocation plugin header file describes an @interface class that derives
from GCPlugin.  Any class deriving from the GCPlugin will be instantiated via
Objective C reflection when your game starts, so it is important to `#import
"PluginManager.h"` so that the GCPlugin declaration is visible to the Xcode
compiler at build time and your code can compile.

~~~
#import "PluginManager.h"
#import <CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h>

@interface GeolocPlugin : GCPlugin<CLLocationManagerDelegate>
@property (nonatomic, retain) CLLocationManager *locationMgr;
@property (nonatomic, retain) CLLocation *lastLocation;
@property (nonatomic, assign) bool requested;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSDate *lastRequestTimestamp;

- (void)getNewLocation;
@end
~~~

Note also that the GeolocPlugin derives from GCPlugin and furthermore
implements the CLLocationManagerDelegate @protocol so that it can receive GPS
updates.

#### Source

Since the header and source files are added as files to the Xcode project, they
need to include any headers required as normal.  So the `GeoLoc.mm` file starts
by including its header:

~~~
#import "GeoLoc.h"
~~~

Then the @implementation for the @interface begins:

~~~
@implementation GeolocPlugin

// The plugin must call super dealloc.
- (void) dealloc {
    self.locationMgr = nil;
    self.lastLocation = nil;

	[super dealloc];
}

// The plugin must call super init.
- (id) init {
	self = [super init];
	if (!self) {
		return nil;
	}

	self.locationMgr = [[[CLLocationManager alloc] init] autorelease];
	self.locationMgr.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest;
	self.locationMgr.delegate = self;
	self.lastLocation = nil;

	return self;
}
~~~

Your plugin must call `[super init]` on `init` as shown above.  This step is
required so that your plugin will receive events from JavaScript.

The plugins should also call `[super dealloc]` on `dealloc` to avoid leaking
memory.

The GeoLocation plugin responds to the CLLocationManagerDelegate
`locationManager` selector so that it can track GPS position updates.

~~~
- (void) locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager
     didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation
            fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation {
}
~~~

The GeoLoc plugin also responds to the GCPluginProtocol
`initializeWithManifest` selector as required.  It does not have any
initialization tasks in this case.

The `manifest` NSDictionary object is an ObjC version of the `manifest.json`
file, so you can read any configuration data for your plugin here:

~~~
- (void) initializeWithManifest:(NSDictionary *)manifest appDelegate:(TeaLeafAppDelegate *)appDelegate {
	NSLOG(@"{geoloc} Initialized with manifest");
}
~~~

##### Handling JavaScript Events

To send the event from JavaScript:

~~~
var e = {method:"getPosition"};
NATIVE.plugins.sendEvent("GeolocPlugin", "onRequest", JSON.stringify(e));
~~~

It is important that the case of the class name matches the case of the event.
And it should be the same class name used for the Android version.  So
"GeolocPlugin" in the above JavaScript code is the same as the `GeolocPlugin`
class name in the native code.

The `onRequest` selector for the GeoLoc plugin demonstrates how to respond to
events from JavaScript:

~~~
- (void) onRequest:(NSDictionary *)jsonObject {
	NSString *method = [jsonObject valueForKey:@"method"];

	if ([method isEqualToString:@"getPosition"]) {
		NSLOG(@"{geoloc} Got request");

		[[PluginManager get] dispatchJSEvent:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
		@"geoloc",@"name", kCFBooleanTrue, @"failed", nil]];
	}
}

@end
~~~

The "onRequest" event name in the JavaScript must match the name of the
selector `onRequest:` used to handle it in the native code.

If you have multiple events, you can handle each one with a different selector.
Or you can multiplex on the JSON object data by providing different `method`
strings as above.

##### Sending JavaScript Events

The `PluginManger` singleton has a `dispatchJSEvent` selector you can use to
send NSDictionary objects back to JavaScript.  The `name` field will be the
event name that the JavaScript code must register to listen for.  Any other
data in the returned NSDictionary object will also be visible to JavaScript.
You may invoke it like this:

~~~
	[[PluginManager get] dispatchJSEvent:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
	@"geoloc",@"name", kCFBooleanTrue, @"failed", nil]];
~~~

The PluginManager will serialize the event for you into a string that can be
read from JavaScript in the NATIVE event handler.  In this case the object will
look like:

~~~
{
	name: "geoloc",
	failed: true
}
~~~

The name of the event must be included and should be unique to your plugin.  It
should match the event name chosen for the Android version of your plugin.

And the JavaScript wrapper will listen for this event by registering for it:

~~~
NATIVE.events.registerHandler('geoloc', function(e) {
	if (!e.failed) {
		logger.log("{geoloc} Got response:", e.longitude, e.latitude);
	}
});
~~~

It is a good idea to wrap this message passing code inside your JavaScript
wrapper so that the user of your plugin does not need to call any NATIVE
functions directly.
