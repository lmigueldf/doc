# TestFlight Guide


##Team Setup

Browse to your [testflightapp.com](http://testflightapp.com) account.

If the user is new, click [Add Teammate] in the upper right.

1. Send them an invite and have them accept it.
2. Have them add a device to their test account.

Click the People tab at top left.
Create a new distribution list of the testers you want to have access to your app.
View your distribution list by selecting it on the bottom left.

Under the |Actions| drop-down at the right, select "Export Devices".  -- This exports the device IDs to `testflight_devices.txt`.

Browse to your developer.apple.com Member Center : Provisioning Portal : Devices section.

##Building

From your app directory run this command:
`$ devkit release native-ios --ipa --provision "/Users/bboy/Desktop/BeardsOnBoards.mobileprovision" --name="Bob Baxter"`
It will create an .IPA file under build/native-ios/appShortName/appShortName.ipa

Browse to your [testflightapp.com](http://testflightapp.com) account.
Since this is a new build, click **[Upload Build]** in the upper right.
Select the IPA file you built, and add some release notes, then hit **[Upload>>]**.

Click the Builds section at the top, and add that distribution list to the build.
You can optionally notify users via Email.

On the iPhone/iPad:
Open TestFlight and note that the new build is now available in the list.

Install and run!
