# Troubleshooting Issues on iOS

## Overview

When your game becomes unresponsive it may be due to a JavaScript exception.
Check the JavaScript logs (see below) to figure out what caused the problem.

## Using iOS Devices

General knowledge of how to use iOS devices is helpful while solving game
problems:

### Uninstalling Games

To uninstall a game on iOS:

1. Navigate to the home screen.
2. Tap and hold on the game icon until the icon starts to shiver.
3. Tap the (X) that appears and tap [Delete].
4. Press the Home button to exit the delete mode.

### Force-Quitting Games

To force-quit a game on an iPad:

1. Tap the Home button to return to the home screen.
2. Double-tap the Home button, revealing an icon list at the bottom.
3. Tap and hold on the game icon in the revealed list at the bottom until the icon starts to shiver.
4. Tap the (-) that appears to force-quit the game.
5. Tap the Home button to exit the force-quit mode.
6. Tap the Home button again to return to the home screen.

## Watching JavaScript Logs

JavaScript logs are generated when you use `console.log` from within your code,
and the Game Closure DevKit will also write out helpful messages
that may point you in the right direction.

When building with Xcode, the logs will scroll in the Debug area at the bottom
of the Xcode project window in the right-side tab.

When the Xcode debugger is detached you can still view the logs of a connected
device using the Organizer, which may be accessed from the Window menu.  Select
the devices tab in the Organizer and scroll down the list of devices to select
the "Console" item under the device you have connected.

## JavaScript Freezes

If your JavaScript game freezes up, it can be due to either an Exception, or a
Memory Leak.  To figure out which problem it is, follow instructions above to
watch the JavaScript logs.

If you see an exception trace in the log then it will contain information about
which source file and line caused the error.  You may want to use the [remote
JS debugger](./ios-remote-debug.html) to set a breakpoint a little before the
exception line so that you may fully inspect the code state from the comfort of
your desktop.  You can also turn on break-on-exception to cause the debugger to
halt at the line where the exception occurs.

If you see "JavaScript error out of memory" at the console then you probably
have a memory leak.  The best way to debug this sort of issue is to back off to
using just your browser for development.  Chrome has the best heap profiler
available, and you can [use
it](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/heap-profiling)
to find and fix JavaScript memory leaks.

## Sound Problems

On iOS you cannot play .OGG audio, so ensure that your sound files are in .MP3
format as discussed in the [audio production
guide](../guide/audio-assets.html).  With the Game Closure DevKit, you can
easily support both .OGG for Android and .MP3 for iOS by having two copies of
each sound file.  When building, `devkit` will take the .OGG version when it can
be used on the target platform (Android for example) and will fall back to the
.MP3 extension version if needed (iOS).  Inside your game, name your sound
files with a .MP3 extension rather than .OGG.

On iOS devices there is a switch that can mute audio, so make sure that did not
get flipped by accident.

There is also a hidden audio menu that you can access by double-tapping the
Home button and swiping the bottom icon ribbon that appears to the right.
Verify that the audio controls do not have sound muted there.

## Custom TrueType Fonts Not Working

On iOS, it is crucial that custom fonts do not have the same name as a default
system font.  A complete list of default iOS fonts is available at
[iosfonts.com](http://iosfonts.com).

Make sure that you have included the .TTF (TrueType Font) file under
`./resources/fonts` in your game directory.  And that under `./manifest.json`
you have a "ttf" section containing the relative path to the file, as in the
following example:

~~~
	"ttf": [
		"resources/fonts/Arial Black.ttf"
	],
~~~

Inside your game you can reference the font by one of the names inside the font
file.  For best interoperability, the .TTF file name should also match one of
the names inside the font file.  For example:

~~~
	var textview = new TextView({
		superview: this.view,
		layout: "box",
		text: "Hello, world!",
		fontFamily: "Arial Black",
		size: 50,
		verticalAlign: "top",
		color: "#00ffff",
		width: 500,
		height: 20,
		x: 200,
		y: 100,
		backgroundColor: "#ff7733"
	});
~~~

## Device Communication Failures

Sometimes Xcode will be unable to communicate with the device.  First attempt
to Stop the Xcode process and restart it.  Uninstall your game.  Then restart
Xcode and try reinstalling.

If this doesn't help, rebooting the iOS device is sometimes the only option to
restore communications.  This mainly seems to happen when breaking connection
while using native breakpoints in Xcode.  For particularly bad lockups, holding
down the home + top button together for a few seconds will cause the phone to
power off.

## EMFILE Release Build Failures

The release builds open a lot of files during the JavaScript code compression
step.  If you see "Error: EMFILE, too many open files" in your build log then
you should run this command at a console: `sudo ulimit -S -n 2048` to increase
the open file limit.

## Advanced: Debugging Native Code

If the native DevKit code is crashing and you want to help looking into the
issue, then you will want to go into the Build Settings for the Xcode project
and change some options to enable debugging:

+ Generate Debug Symbols: `Yes`
+ Link-Time Optimization: `Yes`
+ Optimization Level: `None [-O0]`
+ Unroll Loops: `No`

Be sure to turn this off again for your release builds for maximum performance!  And thanks in advance!
