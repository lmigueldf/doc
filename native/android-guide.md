# Android Development Guide

This guide takes you through the entire process of developing for Android
devices with the Game Closure DevKit.

## [Overview](./android-stages.html)

The development cycle can be broken down into [four
stages](./android-stages.html), leading up to deployment on Google Play.
Initially, all development is done with [web tools](../guide/install.html) and
emulated devices.

Then the [Test App](./android-test-app.html) is used to accelerate transition
onto mobile devices.

Then [Android building](./android-build.html) is encouraged to test and demo
your game, with the help of [remote debugging](./android-remote-debug.html)
tools.

Finally your app is ready for deployment via Google Play.

## [Setup](./android-setup.html)

The [Game Closure DevKit setup guides](./android-setup.html) will get you up
and running as fast as possible.

## [Test App](./android-test-app.html)

With the [Test App](./android-test-app.html) you can quickly iterate through
changes to your game on a mobile device.

## [Build](./android-build.html)

When you are ready to start building your game, the [build
guide](./android-build.html) will make the process smooth and showcase all of
the powerful options available.

## [Remote Debugging](./android-remote-debug.html)

The integrated [remote JavaScript debugging](./android-remote-debug.html)
allows you to isolate and annihilate *all* the bugs.

## [Troubleshooting](./android-troubleshooting.html)

There is a brief troubleshooting guide available
[here](./android-troubleshooting.html).

## [Plugins](./android-plugin.html)

The Android native code can be modified in a reusable way by using the provided
[plugin system](./android-plugin.html).
