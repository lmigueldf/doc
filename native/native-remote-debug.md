# Game Closure Remote JavaScript Debugger

## Overview

The GameClosure [Native
Inspector](http://github.com/gameclosure/NativeInspector) is a node.js project
that provides:

+ JavaScript debugging
+ Console logs
+ Object inspection
+ Break-on-exception
+ CPU profiling
+ Heap profiling

â€¦all over a network connection with a mobile Android or iOS device.

## How it Works

NativeInspector runs a web server that hosts a modified copy of the
bleeding-edge [WebKit Web Inspector
code](http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/Source/WebCore/inspector/front-end/)
that is part of the Chrome browser.  We fixed bugs and added features required
for use with the DevKit.

The general approach is inspired by Danny Coates'
[node-inspector](https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector) project.  This
is a complete cleanroom implementation with different goals.  The primary
difference in motivation is that this project is supposed to integrate
perfectly with the Game Closure DevKit on Android and iOS.

### Network Protocol

When communicating with the devices, the [D8
protocol](http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/DebuggerProtocol) is used, which is
a very limited subset of the full WebKit debug protocol (which includes DOM,
etc). NativeInspector is primarily used to wrap D8 in a
WebKit-compatible layer.

Google documentation on remote debugging is available
[here](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#protocol).

### Android

NativeInspector actively attempts to use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to
connect to port 9222 on an Android device attached via USB data cable.

On the device side, the Android codebase for Game Closure runs a V8 Debug
Server.  This implements nearly all of the features required; we added heap and
CPU profiling hooks into our iOS codebase also (such as
        `PROFILING.getHeaders()`), so that these can be remotely evaluated from
the NativeInspector code when profiling is requested in the web interface.

### iOS

NativeInspector also attempts to connect to any IP addresses that have been
identified by a simple UDP datagram protocol.  NativeInspector listens on UDP
port 9320 on the localhost.  Received datagrams must contain a valid JSON
string with the format: `{ "name": "connect", "addr": "10.1.1.123" }`.  This is
the approach used to connect to iOS devices on the LAN.

On the device side, the iOS codebase for Game Closure runs a custom debug
server written from scratch.  The core of the D8 protocol is implemented in
Objective-C++ for this platform, making it mostly feature-complete.


## Troubleshooting

Try the following steps in order of increasing severity:

1. Refresh the browser
2. Reinstall the app
3. Restart tealeaf serve
4. Close out of everything and restart.

## Installation

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/gameclosure/NativeInspector
$ cd NativeInspector
$ npm install
~~~

Note that this requires `npm` to install.  This tool is available as part of
the `nodejs` package.

The front-end is only confirmed to work with Google Chrome so you may also want
to install Chrome.

## Usage

~~~
$ node NativeInspector
~~~

Browse to [localhost:9220](http://localhost:9220) to view the web inspector
front-end.
