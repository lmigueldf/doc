# iOS Remote JavaScript Debugging

## Overview

On a mobile iOS device it is possible to watch console logs, inspect JavaScript
objects, set breakpoints in running JavaScript code, and break on exceptions
with the Game Closure DevKit.  This feature is called Remote JavaScript
Debugging and is only available in the Game Closure iOS Test App.

When your JavaScript code throws an exception running on the native device but
not the browser, normally you would be out of luck.  A typical way to debug
these issues would be to laborously sprinkle log statements throughout your
code to hopefully gain enough visibility into what it is doing.

A more direct approach would be to break on the exception and inspect the
JavaScript objects leading to the exception, or set a breakpoint on code
leading up to the problem and watch it develop.  Remote JavaScript Debugging
hooks you directly into the code execution and allows you to fully and
transparently analyze the problem.

## Setup

Install the [Native Inspector](https://github.com/gameclosure/nativeinspector)
using the directions in the readme.

Start the Native Inspector by navigating to the Native Inspector directory
and running:

`node NativeInspector.js`


This will start the native inspector server, which by listens on port 9220
by default.
~~~
Inspect: Listening for browsers
Inspect: Listening for controllers on port 9320
Inspect: Debug client started for localhost : 9222
Inspect: Lurking at http://0.0.0.0:9220
~~~

Open your Chrome browser and go to localhost:9220.

Remote JavaScript debugging is only available when using the [Test
App](./ios-test-app.html).  To install the test app, launch its Xcode project
([see test app documentation](./ios-test-app.html)), attach a mobile device,
and run the Xcode project on the device.

## Console Usage

When the Test App on the mobile device loads a game, the remote debugger will
connect to the mobile device.  The web inspector pane will display the console
output from your game.

At the console you are able to run JavaScript commands that are evaluated in
the JavaScript context of the mobile device.  Furthermore, while execution is
paused you may execute JavaScript in the scope of the current function.  The
console will display log messages you would normally see at the Xcode console.
It will also show when scripts are loaded and other useful information for
analyzing the execution of your game.

## Sources Usage

Click over to the Sources tab to view game source code and interact with the
web inspector as you would with a familiar web inspector session in the
browser.  The most useful debugging features will work remotely.

There are two tabs for scripts on the left.  The left tab contains your game
source code, and the right tab entitled "Content Scripts" contains the DevKit
JavaScript source code.

To break on exceptions, start the debugging session before the exception
occurs, and click on the (") pause button in the lower left until it displays
blue.  In this state, when an exception occurs in JavaScript, the remote
debugger will break on the exception line.

While at a breakpoint you can mouse-over or enter a variable name in the
console to inspect its value.

From left to right:

+ Console pop-up
+ Break on Exceptions: Black = Off, Blue or Purple = On
+ Prettify: Unmangle JavaScript

### Sources Tools: Upper-Right Toolbar

From left to right:

+ Pause or resume JavaScript interpreter where it is currently executing
+ While execution is paused: Step over currently selected line
+ While execution is paused: Step into currently selected function
+ While execution is paused: Step out of current function scope
+ Disable or enable all breakpoints

## Troubleshooting Issues

If the debugger becomes unresponsive, attempt to refresh the browser window.
If that doesn't work, force-quit your game and restart it also.
