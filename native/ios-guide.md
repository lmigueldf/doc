# iOS Development Guide

This guide takes you through the entire process of developing for iOS devices
with the Game Closure DevKit.

## [Overview](./ios-stages.html)

The development cycle can be broken down into [five stages](./ios-stages.html),
leading up to deployment on the iTunes App Store.  Initially, all
development is done with [web tools](../guide/install.html) and emulated
devices.

Then the [Test App](./ios-test-app.html) is used to accelerate transition onto
the mobile devices, with the help of [remote
debugging](./ios-remote-debug.html) tools.

Then [iOS building](./ios-build.html) is encouraged to test and demo your game,
which graduates into group testing with TestFlight, and finally deployment
via the iTunes App Store.

## [Setup](./ios-setup.html)

The [Game Closure DevKit setup guides](./ios-setup.html) will get you up and
running as fast as possible.

## [Test App](./ios-test-app.html) with [Remote Debugging](./ios-remote-debug.html)

With the [Test App](./ios-test-app.html) you can quickly iterate through
changes to your game on a mobile device, and the integrated [remote JavaScript
debugging](./ios-remote-debug.html) allows you to isolate and annihilate *all*
the bugs.

## [Build](./ios-build.html)

When you are ready to start building your game, the [build
guide](./ios-build.html) will make the process smooth and showcase all of the
powerful options available.

## [TestFlight](./ios-testflight.html)

For larger scale group testing, you may consider using TestFlight for
coordination.  The [TestFlight Guide](./ios-testflight.html) will get you
through the set up process.

## [Troubleshooting](./ios-troubleshooting.html)

There is a brief troubleshooting guide available
[here](./ios-troubleshooting.html).

## [Plugins](./ios-plugin.html)

The iOS native code can be modified in a reusable way by using the provided
[plugin system](./ios-plugin.html).
